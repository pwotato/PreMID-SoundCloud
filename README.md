# PreMID-SoundCloud
Tweaked SoundCloud presence for PreMID
I take no credit for this
Find PreMID Here: https://premid.app/ | https://github.com/PreMiD/Activities

# Usage:
Install PreMID
Setup PreMID for development (guide here: https://docs.premid.app/en/dev/presence)
Follow the "Compiling / Modifying a Presence" instructions (command: npx pmd dev SoundCloud)
Go to websites\S\SoundCloud
Replace presence.ts with the presence.ts in this repository (either by copy + pasting the contents over or replacing the file as a whole)
Save presence.ts and the extension should automatically update and work
You probably shouldn't delete the PreMID source/folder, so just... leave it there
