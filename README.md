**Tweaked SoundCloud discord presence for PreMID**

I take no credit for this!

**Find PreMID Here: https://premid.app/ | https://github.com/PreMiD/Activities | https://github.com/PreMiD/Activities/tree/main/websites/S/SoundCloud**

# Usage:
1. Install PreMID
2. Setup PreMID for development (guide here: https://docs.premid.app/en/dev/presence)
3. Follow the "Compiling / Modifying a Presence" instructions (command: npx pmd dev SoundCloud)
4. Go to "Activities\websites\S\SoundCloud"
5. Replace presence.ts with the presence.ts in this repository (preferably by copying and pasting the contents over using a text editor)
6. Save presence.ts and the extension should automatically update and work
7. You probably shouldn't delete the PreMID source/folder, so just... leave it there
